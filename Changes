Revision history for Perl module Math::FakeDD

0.07
 - Bug fix for https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=144891

0.06
 - Doc fix for FakeDD.pod -see https://github.com/sisyphus/math-fakedd/issues/1
   Thanks, Peter Acklam.
 - Add overload_copy() which overloads the assignment operator ('=')
   Also add dd_copy() and dd_clone() - both of which return a copy of their
   Math::FakeDD object argument.
   Thanks again, Peter Acklam.
 - Have dd_repro() check that Math::MPFR is at version 4.24 or later. (This is done
   in case Math::FakeDD is installed into a location where it becomes accessible to
   a perl whose version of Math::MPFR is pre-4.24.)
 - Have mpfr2dd() return an (appropriately signed) Inf whenever it has calculated
   the DoubleDouble to be either [DBL_MAX, 2**970] or [-DBL_MAX, -(2**970)].
   (DBL_MAX is 0x1.fffffffffffffp+1023, which is the largest possible finite double.)
   Add checks for this to t/assign.t and t/add.t.
   Thanks, Peter Acklam.
 - Add overloading of '++' and '--'.
 - Add dd_nextup() and dd_nextdown().
 - Add is_subnormal() and ulp_exponent().
 - Add any2dd()

0.05
 - Extra test (for correct handling of trailing zeros) added to dd_repro_test()
 - Add dd_exp2, dd_exp10, dd_log2 and dd_log10 functions.
 - Add dd_pi, dd_euler and dd_catalan functions.
 - In Makefile.PL, overwrite INSTALLSITELIB to $Config::Config{installsitearch} to
   ensure that Math::FakeDD is installed into site/lib/<archname> when applicable.

0.04
 - More corrections to dd_repro().
 - Add new test file t/sparse.t.
 - Add dd_numify() - mainly for '0+' overloading.
 - Add dd_repro_test().
 - Add new test file t/dd_repro_basics.t.

0.03
 - Allow for mpfr versions older than 4.0.0, as they set minimum allowed precision
   to 2 bits. (Beginning with 4.0.0, this minimum has been set to 1.)
 - Correct the 'repository' settings in Makefile.PL

0.02
 - Add (and export) dd_inf, dd_nan, dd_is_inf, dd_is_nan, sprintx, printx, unpackx, dd_hex.
 - Export dd2mpfr, mpfr2dd, mpfr2098.
 - Fix dd_repro().
