=head1 NAME

  Math::FakeDD - DoubleDouble precision arithmetic for all architectures

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

  This module needs Math::MPFR, which in turn requires the GMP and MPFR
  C libraries.

  The GMP library is available from  : https://gmplib.org
  The MPFR library is available from : https://www.mpfr.org

  See the introductory explanation of "DoubleDouble" arithmetic in the
  "Double-double arithmetic" section of:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruple-precision_floating-point_format

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  Perform DoubleDouble arithmetic operations on all architectures and
  perl configurations.
  See ARITMETIC IMPLEMENTATION section below.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::FakeDD qw(:all);
  my $obj = Math::FakeDD->new('0.1');
  print $obj; # Outputs [0.1 -5.551115123125783e-18] irrespective of
              # perl's NV type. We see that the more significant double
              # is 0.1, identical to the double precision representation
              # of 0.1, and the less signficant double is
              # -5.551115123125783e-18.

  my $obj =  Math::FakeDD->new(0.1);
  print $obj; # Outputs [0.1 0.0] if NV type is 'double'.
              # Outputs [0.1 -5.549759870410176e-18] if NV type is
              # extended precision 80-bit long double.
              # Otherwise outputs [0.1 -5.551115123125783e-18], same
              # as for string arg of '0.1'.

  Generally, providing a string argument will DWYW, whereas providing a
  floating-point (NV) argument won't. (Of course, exceptions exist and
  you should familiarise yourself with the difference if it is not
  already clear to you.)

  printx($obj); # Same as for print() execept that values are in hex.
  print sprintx($obj);  # Same as 'printx($obj)'.
  print dd_repro($obj); # $obj in scientific notation (in decimal).

  # Verify that the string returned by dd_repro($obj) is correct:
  print "ok" if dd_repro_test(dd_repro($obj), $obj) == 15;

  print dd_dec($obj); # Exact representation of the value held by $obj,
                      # in scientific notation .

  NOTES: In the following documentation:

   "$arg", "$arg1", "$arg2", etc. are arguments that can be either a
    string (perl PV), a native perl numeric type (NV or IV or UV), or
    a Math::FakeDD object.

    "$obj" is a Math::FakeDD object.

    "$mpfr" is a 2098-bit precision Math::MPFR object.

   or zero if no argument is provided.

  dd_assign($obj, $arg);

   Assigns the value represented by $arg, to the Math::FakeDD object.

=head1 ARITHMETIC FUNCTIONS

  Use either the functions, or the overloaded
  operations (that use these functions).

  $obj = dd_add($arg1, $arg2);
  $obj = dd_sub($arg1, $arg2);
  $obj = dd_mul($arg1, $arg2);
  $obj = dd_div($arg1, $arg2);

  dd_add_eq($obj, $arg);
  dd_sub_eq($obj, $arg);
  dd_mul_eq($obj, $arg);
  dd_div_eq($obj, $arg);

   The value in $obj is (respectively) incremented, decremented,
   multiplied or divided by $arg.

  $obj = dd_pow($arg1, $arg2);

   Return a Math::FakeDD object that contains $arg1 ** $arg2.


  dd_pow_eq($obj, $arg);

   The value held in $obj is raised to the power of $arg.
   (That is, $obj = $obj ** $arg.)

  $obj = dd_abs($arg);

   Return a Math::FakeDD object containing the absolute value of $arg.

  $obj = dd_int($arg);

   Return a Math::FakeDD object containing the truncated
   (integer) value of $arg.

=head1 EXPONENTIATION FUNCTIONS

   e ** $arg, 2 ** $arg, 10 ** $arg.

  $obj = dd_log($arg);
  $obj = dd_log2($arg);
  $obj = dd_log10($arg);

   Return a Math::FakeDD object that contains respectively
   the natural log of $arg, the base 2 log of $arg, the
   base 10 log of $arg.

=head1 TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS

  $obj = dd_pi();
  $obj = dd_euler();
  $obj = dd_catalan();

  Return (respectively) pi (3.141...), Euler's constant (0.577...)
  and Catalan's constant (0.577...) .

=head1 TRIGONOMETRY FUNCTIONS

  $obj = dd_cos($arg);

   Return a Math::FakeDD object that contains cos($arg).

  $obj = dd_sin($arg);

   Return a Math::FakeDD object that contains sin($arg).

=head1 COMPARISON FUNCTIONS

  $iv = dd_cmp($arg1, $arg2);
  $iv = dd_spaceship($arg1, $arg2);

   Return undef if at least one of $arg1
   and $arg2 is NaN
   $iv < 0  if $arg1 <  $arg2.
   $iv > 0  if $arg1 >  $arg2.
   $iv == 0 if $arg1 == $arg2.

  $iv = dd_eq ($arg1, $arg2);
  $iv = dd_neq($arg1, $arg2);
  $iv = dd_gt($arg1, $arg2);
  $iv = dd_gte($arg1, $arg2);

   If (respectively) $arg1 == $arg2, $arg1 != $arg2,
   $arg1 > $arg2, $arg1 >= $arg2, $arg1 < $arg2, $arg1 <= $arg2,
   then $integer is set to 1.
   Else $integer is set to 0.

  $iv = dd_streq($obj, $arg);
   We need this function only because Test::More can pull
   in code that assumes 'eq' is overloaded. (And this is the
   function that overloaded 'eq' calls.)
   Return 1 if "$obj" eq "$arg".
   Else return 0;

  $iv = dd_strne($obj, $arg);
   We provide this function only because dd_stre() is provided.
   Return 1 if "$obj" ne "$arg".
   Else return 0;

=head1 OUTPUT FUNCTIONS

  $str = dd_dec($obj); # "dec" short for "decimalize"

   Represent the *exact* value of $obj in scientific notation,
   using as few digits as required to provide that exactness.
   As with dd_repro(), if this $str is assigned to a new
   Math::FakeDD object, then the new Math::FakeDD object will
   be identical to the Math::FakeDD object from which this
   $str was derived. However, the number of mantissa digits
   returned by dd_dec() will be >= (usually greater than) the
   number of mantissa digits returned by dd_repro().

  $str = dd_hex($obj);

   As for dd_dec(), except that the value placed in $str is in
   hex ("%a") format.


  $str = dd_repro($obj); # "repro" short for "reproducible"

   #### NOTE: This function has turned into a much uglier hack
              than I had envisaged. See the "TODO" section below
              for elaboration.

   Represent the value of $obj in decimal scientific notation,
   using as few decimal mantissa digits as possible, such that if
   this $str is assigned to a new Math::FakeDD object, then the
   new Math::FakeDD object will be identical to (ie a reproduction
   of) the Math::FakeDD object from which $str was derived.
   Also set $Math::FakeDD::RETRO_PREC to the bit-precision value
   that was used in determining $str.
   If $Math::FakeDD::REPRO_PREC begins with ">", then the value that
   dd_repro() returned was altered slightly (away from zero) from
   the value that was calculated using the specified precision.
   If $Math::FakeDD::REPRO_PREC begins with "<", then the value that
   dd_repro() returned was altered slightly (toward zero) from the
   value that was calculated using the specified precision.
   Other possible $Math::FakeDD::REPRO_PREC values, all of which
   indicate that no calcuation of precision has been made, are:
    -1: the initial value, and dd_repro() has not been called at all;
    0 : dd_repro returned an Inf, NaN or Zero;
    undef: perl's nvtype is DoubleDouble, so dd_repro() simply used
           Math::MPFR::nvtoa().

  $iv = dd_repro_test(dd_repro($obj), $obj, $debug); # 3rd arg is optional

   Check that the representation of dd_repro($obj) returned by
   dd_repro() is accurate, and that it uses the fewest significant
   decimal mantissa digits possible.
   Some debugging output is provided if the third (optional) arg
   is true.
   The function assigns its first arg, dd_repro($obj), to a
   string - let's call it $str.

   4 tests are conducted:

   1) that Math::FakeDD->new($str) == $obj.
      $iv & 1 will be true if and only if this test passes.

   2) that if we were to round $str *down* to 1 less significant decimal
      digit then Math::FakeDD->new($str) < $obj.
      $iv & 2 will be true if and only if this test passes.

   3) that if we were round $str *up* to 1 less significant decimal
      digit then Math::FakeDD->new($str) > $obj.
      $iv & 4 will be true if and only if this test passes.

   4) that there are no errant trailing zeroes in the mantissa portion
      of $str.
      $iv & 8 will be true if and only if this test passes.

   If all four tests pass (in which case the returned $iv == 15) then
   we know that dd_repro($obj) has functioned correctly and as intended.
   Else, dd_repro() has not functioned correctly and we can determine
   which test(s) failed by examining the 4 lowest bits of $iv.

  $str = dd_stringify($obj);

   Return a string that begins with "[" and ends with "]".
   In between show, a space-delimited decimal string
   representation of the more significant double followed by the
   less significant double. Both doubles  will be shown in as few
   digits as possible, while not losing any information.
   The overloading of interpolation uses this function.

  $nv = dd_numify($obj); # Mainly for '0+' overloading.

   Converts $obj to an NV, as accurately as the precision of the NV
   allows.

  printx($obj);

   Same as doing:
     print(sprintx($obj)); # see below for sprintx documentation.

  $str = sprintx($obj);

   Same as dd_stringify($obj), except that the 2 doubles are
   presented in hex ("%a") format, instead of decimal format.

  $str = unpackx($obj);

   Same as dd_stringify($obj), except that the 2 doubles have
   each been unpacked into hex format by doing:

     unpack "H*", pack "d>", $double;

=head1 OPERATOR OVERLOADING

  The following operations are currently overloaded:
   "", 0+, ==, !=, *, *=, **, **=, +, +=, -, -=, /, /=, <, <=, <=>, >, >=,
   abs, int, exp, log, sqrt,
   bool, !,
   atan2, cos, sin
   eq, ne

  Run
    my %oloads = Math::FakeDD::oload();

  The keys are the overloaded operations, and their respective values
  name the functions used in the respective operation.
  These functions are documented above - except for dd_true() and
  dd_false() which are documented here:

  $iv = dd_true($obj);

   This function is not exported.
   It is intended to be called only by overloading of 'bool'.
   Returns 1 unless $obj is NaN or zero; else returns 0.
   (This is the same criterion as used by Math::MPFR's overloading
   of 'bool'.)

  $iv = dd_false($obj);

   This function is not exported.
   It is intended to be called only by overloading of '!'.
   Returns 1 if $obj is NaN or zero; else returns 0.
   (This is the same criterion as used by Math::MPFR's overloading
   of '!'.)

=head1 OTHER FUNCTIONS

  $obj = dd_inf([$iv]); # $iv is an optional arg, which will be
                        # evaluated in (signed) numeric context

    If the optional arg $iv, is less than 0 (in numeric context, then
    a Math::FakeDD object with value -Inf is returned.
    Else return a +Inf Math::FakeDD object.

  $obj = dd_nan();

    Return a NaN Math::FakeDD object.

  $iv = dd_is_inf($obj);

    Returns 1 if $obj is an infinity.
    Else returns 0.

  $iv = dd_is_nan($obj);

    Returns 1 if $obj is a NaN.
    Else returns 0.

  $obj = mpfr2dd         ($mpfr); # Precision of $mpfr is 2098 bits.
  $obj = mpfr_any_prec2dd($mpfr); # Precision of $mpfr is unrestricted.

   Return the value held by the 2 Math::MPFR object $mpfr as the
   Math::FakeDD object $obj.
   Precision can be (and often is) lost in this conversion.

  $mpfr = dd2mpfr($obj);

   Return the value held by the Math::FakeDD object $obj as a 2098-bit
   precision Math::MPFR object $mpfr.
   No precision is lost in this conversion.

  $mpfr = mpfr2098($in);

   Return the value held by $in as the 2098-bit precision Math::MPFR
   object $mpfr.
   $in can be a string (PV), an integer (IV), an unsigned integer (UV),
   a perl floating point (NV) - but not a Math::FakeDD object.
   To convert a Math::FakeDD object to a 2098-bit precision Math::MPFR
   object, use dd2mpfr() instead.


=head1 ARITHMETIC IMPLEMENTATION

  Operands are first converted to a 2098-bit Math::MPFR object value.
  If the operand is a Math::FakeDD object then the conversion is exact.
  Else, the conversion might not be exact, depending upon the value.
  The result of the operation on the 2098-bit operand(s) will also be
  rounded to 2098 bits, and that value will then be rounded to its
  DoubleDouble format and returned as a Math::FakeDD object.
  DoubleDoubles with real values have precision of between 107 and
  2098 bits (depending upon their value), except for subnormalized
  double precision values where precision is in the range 1 to 52
  bits (depending upon value).

  All rounding is done to nearest, with ties to even.

=head1 TODO

  Re-factor dd_repro(), which is currently just an awful hack.
  Also, it's possible that dd_repro() doesn't work correctly for all
  possible DoubleDouble values. It's recommended that, if this
  matters, then dd_repro_test() should be run to check on the
  correctness of the values that dd_repro() returns.
  Please report any such errors, as that will be helpful with the
  intended re-factoring.
